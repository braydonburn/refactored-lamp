Scripts to restart blueman bluetooth manager when lid is closed to avoid weird wake up issues.

Copy restart-bluetooth.sh to /etc/acpi/
Copy lid-power to /etc/acpi/events

Update acpi folder permissions so script can automatically be ran without password:

	Run sudo visudo.

	Add an entry for username and the restart bluetooth script.

	username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/acpi/restart-bluetooth.sh
